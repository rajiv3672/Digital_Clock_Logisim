Hello everyone, I welcome you.
This is my personal project. I made this just to please my mind, need less to say that nobody should
make a clock like this in the real life for their project, this is a highly impractical model.


I used negative edge triggerd T flip-flops to make MOD counters and then used these asynchronously 
with some gates to make a digital clock circuit. 
I used a self made seven segment display driver to display the time.
This clock can show whether it is AM or PM.
Happy electronicing!
